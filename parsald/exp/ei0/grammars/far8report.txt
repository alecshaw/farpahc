In training set we have # of words: 149246
reducing number of training trees from 10644 to 10644
Binarizing and annotating trees...done.
Binarizing and annotating trees...done.
There are 10644 trees in the training set.
Will remove rules with prob under 1.0E-30.
Even though only unlikely rules are pruned the training LL is not guaranteed to increase in every round anymore (especially when we are close to converging).
Furthermore it increases the variance because 'good' rules can be pruned away in early stages.
There are 581 observed categories.
Will merge 50% of the splits in each round.
The threshold for merging lexical and phrasal categories will be set separately: false
Before splitting, we have a total of 581 substates.
After splitting, we have a total of 1161 substates.
Rule probabilities are NOT normalized in the split, therefore the training LL is not guaranteed to improve between iteration 0 and 1!
After splitting in the 1th round, we get a validation likelihood of 0.0

Before splitting, we have a total of 1387 substates.
After splitting, we have a total of 2773 substates.
Rule probabilities are NOT normalized in the split, therefore the training LL is not guaranteed to improve between iteration 0 and 1!
After splitting in the 3th round, we get a validation likelihood of 0.0

Before splitting, we have a total of 2162 substates.
After splitting, we have a total of 4323 substates.
Rule probabilities are NOT normalized in the split, therefore the training LL is not guaranteed to improve between iteration 0 and 1!

Before splitting, we have a total of 5329 substates.
After splitting, we have a total of 10657 substates.
Rule probabilities are NOT normalized in the split, therefore the training LL is not guaranteed to improve between iteration 0 and 1!
After splitting in the 6th round, we get a validation likelihood of 0.0
