In training set we have # of words: 250951
reducing number of training trees from 17946 to 17946
Binarizing and annotating trees...done.
Binarizing and annotating trees...done.
There are 17946 trees in the training set.
Will remove rules with prob under 1.0E-30.
Even though only unlikely rules are pruned the training LL is not guaranteed to increase in every round anymore (especially when we are close to converging).
Furthermore it increases the variance because 'good' rules can be pruned away in early stages.
There are 689 observed categories.
Will merge 50% of the splits in each round.
The threshold for merging lexical and phrasal categories will be set separately: false
Before splitting, we have a total of 689 substates.
After splitting, we have a total of 1377 substates.
Rule probabilities are NOT normalized in the split, therefore the training LL is not guaranteed to improve between iteration 0 and 1!
After splitting in the 1th round, we get a validation likelihood of 0.0

Before splitting, we have a total of 1064 substates.
After splitting, we have a total of 2127 substates.
Rule probabilities are NOT normalized in the split, therefore the training LL is not guaranteed to improve between iteration 0 and 1!
After splitting in the 2th round, we get a validation likelihood of 0.0

Before splitting, we have a total of 1645 substates.
After splitting, we have a total of 3289 substates.
Rule probabilities are NOT normalized in the split, therefore the training LL is not guaranteed to improve between iteration 0 and 1!

Before splitting, we have a total of 2567 substates.
After splitting, we have a total of 5133 substates.
Rule probabilities are NOT normalized in the split, therefore the training LL is not guaranteed to improve between iteration 0 and 1!
After splitting in the 4th round, we get a validation likelihood of 0.0

Before splitting, we have a total of 6339 substates.
After splitting, we have a total of 12677 substates.
Rule probabilities are NOT normalized in the split, therefore the training LL is not guaranteed to improve between iteration 0 and 1!
After splitting in the 6th round, we get a validation likelihood of 0.0
