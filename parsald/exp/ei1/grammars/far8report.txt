In training set we have # of words: 250983
reducing number of training trees from 17946 to 17946
Binarizing and annotating trees...done.
Binarizing and annotating trees...done.
There are 17946 trees in the training set.
Will remove rules with prob under 1.0E-30.
Even though only unlikely rules are pruned the training LL is not guaranteed to increase in every round anymore (especially when we are close to converging).
Furthermore it increases the variance because 'good' rules can be pruned away in early stages.
There are 688 observed categories.
Will merge 50% of the splits in each round.
The threshold for merging lexical and phrasal categories will be set separately: false
Before splitting, we have a total of 688 substates.
After splitting, we have a total of 1375 substates.
Rule probabilities are NOT normalized in the split, therefore the training LL is not guaranteed to improve between iteration 0 and 1!
After splitting in the 1th round, we get a validation likelihood of 0.0

Before splitting, we have a total of 1064 substates.
After splitting, we have a total of 2127 substates.
Rule probabilities are NOT normalized in the split, therefore the training LL is not guaranteed to improve between iteration 0 and 1!
After splitting in the 2th round, we get a validation likelihood of 0.0

Before splitting, we have a total of 1652 substates.
After splitting, we have a total of 3303 substates.
Rule probabilities are NOT normalized in the split, therefore the training LL is not guaranteed to improve between iteration 0 and 1!

Before splitting, we have a total of 2581 substates.
After splitting, we have a total of 5161 substates.
Rule probabilities are NOT normalized in the split, therefore the training LL is not guaranteed to improve between iteration 0 and 1!
After splitting in the 4th round, we get a validation likelihood of 0.0

Before splitting, we have a total of 4063 substates.
After splitting, we have a total of 8125 substates.
Rule probabilities are NOT normalized in the split, therefore the training LL is not guaranteed to improve between iteration 0 and 1!
After splitting in the 5th round, we get a validation likelihood of 0.0

Before splitting, we have a total of 6461 substates.
After splitting, we have a total of 12921 substates.
Rule probabilities are NOT normalized in the split, therefore the training LL is not guaranteed to improve between iteration 0 and 1!
After splitting in the 6th round, we get a validation likelihood of 0.0
