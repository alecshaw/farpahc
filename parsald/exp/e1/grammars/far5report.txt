In training set we have # of words: 49155
reducing number of training trees from 3342 to 3342
Binarizing and annotating trees...done.
Binarizing and annotating trees...done.
There are 3342 trees in the training set.
Will remove rules with prob under 1.0E-30.
Even though only unlikely rules are pruned the training LL is not guaranteed to increase in every round anymore (especially when we are close to converging).
Furthermore it increases the variance because 'good' rules can be pruned away in early stages.
There are 373 observed categories.
Will merge 50% of the splits in each round.
The threshold for merging lexical and phrasal categories will be set separately: false
Before splitting, we have a total of 373 substates.
After splitting, we have a total of 745 substates.
Rule probabilities are NOT normalized in the split, therefore the training LL is not guaranteed to improve between iteration 0 and 1!
After splitting in the 1th round, we get a validation likelihood of 0.0

Before splitting, we have a total of 569 substates.
After splitting, we have a total of 1137 substates.
Rule probabilities are NOT normalized in the split, therefore the training LL is not guaranteed to improve between iteration 0 and 1!
After splitting in the 2th round, we get a validation likelihood of 0.0

Before splitting, we have a total of 877 substates.
After splitting, we have a total of 1753 substates.
Rule probabilities are NOT normalized in the split, therefore the training LL is not guaranteed to improve between iteration 0 and 1!
After splitting in the 3th round, we get a validation likelihood of 0.0

Before splitting, we have a total of 1357 substates.
After splitting, we have a total of 2713 substates.
Rule probabilities are NOT normalized in the split, therefore the training LL is not guaranteed to improve between iteration 0 and 1!
After splitting in the 4th round, we get a validation likelihood of 0.0
